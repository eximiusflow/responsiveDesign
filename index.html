<h2>SIZING ELEMENTS</h2>

<h3>Relative Measurements</h3>
<p>Modern technology allows users to browse the Internet via multiple devices, such as desktop monitors, mobile phones, tablets, and more. Devices of different screen sizes, however, pose a problem for web developers: how can we ensure that a website is readable and visually appealing across all devices, regardless of screen size?</p>
<p>The answer: responsive design! Responsive design refers to the ability of a website to resize and reorganize its content based on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The size of other content on the website.</li>
  <li>The size of the screen the website is being viewed on.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this lesson, we'll size HTML content relative to other content on a website.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed the unit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel" target="_blank">pixels</a>, or px, used in websites. Pixels are used to size content to exact dimensions. For example, if you want a div to be exactly 500 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall, then the unit of px can be used. Pixels, however, are fixed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding" target="_blank">hard coded</a> values. When a screen size changes (like switching from landscape to portrait view on a phone), elements sized with pixels can appear too small, overflow the screen, or become completely illegible.</p>
<p>With CSS, you can avoid hard coded measurements and use relative measurements instead. Relative measurements offer an advantage over hard coded measurements, as they allow for the proportions of a website to remain intact regardless of screen size or layout.</p>
