<h2>SIZING ELEMENTS</h2>

<h3>Relative Measurements</h3>
<p>Modern technology allows users to browse the Internet via multiple devices, such as desktop monitors, mobile phones, tablets, and more. Devices of different screen sizes, however, pose a problem for web developers: how can we ensure that a website is readable and visually appealing across all devices, regardless of screen size?</p>
<p>The answer: responsive design! Responsive design refers to the ability of a website to resize and reorganize its content based on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The size of other content on the website.</li>
  <li>The size of the screen the website is being viewed on.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this lesson, we'll size HTML content relative to other content on a website.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed the unit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel" target="_blank">pixels</a>, or <em>px</em>, used in websites. Pixels are used to size content to exact dimensions. For example, if you want a div to be exactly 500 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall, then the unit of <em>px</em> can be used. Pixels, however, are fixed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding" target="_blank">hard coded</a> values. When a screen size changes (like switching from landscape to portrait view on a phone), elements sized with pixels can appear too small, overflow the screen, or become completely illegible.</p>
<p>With CSS, you can avoid hard coded measurements and use relative measurements instead. Relative measurements offer an advantage over hard coded measurements, as they allow for the proportions of a website to remain intact regardless of screen size or layout.</p>

<h3>Em</h3>
<p>Incorporating relative sizing starts by using units other than pixels. One unit of measurement you can use in CSS to create relatively-sized content is the <em>em</em>, written as <strong>em</strong> in CSS.</p>
<p>Historically, the em represented the width of a capital letter M in the typeface and size being used. That is no longer the case.</p>
<p><strong>Today, the em represents the size of the base font being used.</strong> For example, if the base font of a browser is 16 pixels (which is normally the default size of text in a browser), then 1 em is equal to 16 pixels. 2 ems would equal 32 pixels, and so on.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at two examples that show how em can be used in CSS.</p>
<p><.heading {<br>  font-size: 2em;<br>}/p>
<p>In the example above, no base font has been specified, therefore the font size of the <strong>heading</strong> element will be set relative to the default font size of the browser. Assuming the default font size is 16 pixels, then the font size of the <strong>heading</strong> element will be 32 pixels.</p>
<p>.splash-section {<br>font-size: 18px;<br>}<br>.splash-section h1 {  <br>font-size: 1.5em;<br>}</p>
<p>The example above shows how to use ems without relying on the default font size of the browser. Instead, a base font size (<strong>18px</strong>) is defined for all text within the <strong>splash-section</strong> element. The second CSS rule will set the font size of all <strong>h1</strong> elements inside of <strong>splash-section</strong> relative to the base font of <strong>splash-section</strong> (<strong>18</strong> pixels). The resulting font size of <strong>h1</strong> elements will be <strong>27</strong> pixels.</p>
